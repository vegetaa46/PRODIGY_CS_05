A packet analyzer, also known as a packet sniffer, is a tool used to capture and analyze network traffic. It can be useful for network troubleshooting, performance analysis, security monitoring, and understanding network protocols. In Python, we can create a packet analyzer using libraries such as scapy, pyshark, and socket. Here, we'll use scapy to build a simple packet analyzer.

We'll us Scapy to save captured packets to a file and read them later for analysis This code snippet captures 10 packets, saves them to a file named packets.pcap, and then reads the packets back from the file for processing.
